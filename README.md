# How To Use on Windows (All versions)
1. Open Windows Terminal (Use of terminal is NOT mandatory, you can use Windows PowerShell too.)
2. Copy and paste this command: 
```
iwr rebrand.ly/ytdlpgcli | iex
```

# How to use on Linux (Any distro as long as its DEBIAN based)
If you are a first time user (or you formatted your Linux PC), you need to install powershell. Enter in below command into terminal:
```
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HaiziIzzudin/ytdlp-guided-cli/main/powershell_installer.sh)";
```
Else if you are a comeback customer (or you already have powershell installed), do enter in below command to run.
```
iwr rebrand.ly/ytdlpgcli | iex
```
You need to c&p above command in **POWERSHELL COMMAND** mode. If you are not already in powershell command mode, simply enter in `pwsh`.

### State of maintenance
Android has been removed due to its unfriendly method. I recommend [Seal](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.junkfood.seal/) instead (opens in fdroid)
