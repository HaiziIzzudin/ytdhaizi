# How To Use on Windows (All versions)
1. Open Windows Terminal (Use of terminal is NOT mandatory, you can use Windows PowerShell too.)
2. Copy and paste this command: 
```
iwr github.com/HaiziIzzudin/ytdlp-guided-cli/raw/main/ytdlp_gcli_v10.6.ps1 | iex
```

# Linux !PLEASE WAIT FOR V11!
1. If you are a first time user (or you formatted your Linux PC), you need to INSTALL PowerShell. Enter in below command into terminal. Else if you already has installed PowerShell (or you are a comeback customer), SKIP THIS STEP.
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y curl gnupg apt-transport-https;curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | sudo apt-key add -;sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/microsoft-debian-bullseye-prod bullseye main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/microsoft.list';sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y powershell;
```
2. Enter in `pwsh`.

3. Enter in below command to proceed for further instructions...
```
iwr github.com/HaiziIzzudin/ytdlp-guided-cli/raw/main/ytdlp_gcli_v10.5.ps1 | iex
```
**Please make sure above command is entered inside powershell command mode. It looks like `PS   /home/path >`**

### Android when?
Android has been removed due to its unfriendly method. I recommend [Seal](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.junkfood.seal/) instead (opens in fdroid)
