# How To Use on Windows (All versions)
1. Open Windows Terminal (Use of terminal is NOT mandatory, you can use Windows PowerShell too.)
2. Copy and paste this command: 
```
iwr github.com/HaiziIzzudin/ytdlp-guided-cli/raw/main/ytdlp_gcli_v10.6.ps1 | iex
```

# Linux (UBUNTU)
#### Guide below is only installing yt-dlp (binary download method).
```
sudo rm -rf /usr/bin/yt-dlp; sudo wget -P /usr/bin/ github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp; sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/yt-dlp;
```
Check if installed by entering `yt-dlp` into terminal.

### Android has been removed due to its unfriendly method. I recommend [Seal](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.junkfood.seal/) instead (opens in fdroid)

# Bugs? Wrote it in [issues](https://github.com/HaiziIzzudin/ytdlp-guided-cli/issues).
