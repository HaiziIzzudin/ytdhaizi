# My plans of this software devs...

Android has the most user base, second is Windows. I feel like windows version has finished. I mean you have the basic features, just I will only do bug fix. What I will add more features is on android (termux) side. Due to OS market share most of them is on Android, therefore I will focus on android development. I still allow receiving bugfix. Feel free to issue it.
